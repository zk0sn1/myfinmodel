## 1) Executive Summary

The current codebase is a working scaffold that demonstrates the basic Monte Carlo pattern but implements only a small subset of the functional specification. This document provides a phased implementation plan to bring the code into full alignment with the approved spec, identifies every gap between current code and spec, and specifies the technical design for each module.

---

## 2) Architecture Decisions

### 2.1 Module Structure

The functional spec (Appendix D) suggests a flat file layout (`simulation.py`, `validators.py`, `charts.py`). The current repo uses a package layout (`simulation/`, `ui/`, `utils/`). **Decision: retain the package layout** — it is already established, supports better test isolation, and is compatible with the spec's dependency rules.

Reconciled structure:

```text
myfinmodel/
  app.py                      # Streamlit entry point (UI orchestration only)
  simulation/
    __init__.py
    models.py                 # Dataclasses, enums, type definitions
    engine.py                 # Vectorized Monte Carlo engine (replaces monte_carlo.py)
    guardrails.py             # Guardrail logic (GR1–GR4 + floor/ceiling)
  validation/
    __init__.py
    validators.py             # Input validation — zero Streamlit imports
  ui/
    __init__.py
    inputs.py                 # Inputs tab rendering
    outputs.py                # Results tab rendering
    scenarios.py              # Scenario save/load/compare UI
  utils/
    __init__.py
    charts.py                 # Plotly chart builders — zero Streamlit imports
  tests/
    __init__.py
    test_models.py
    test_engine.py            # Replaces test_monte_carlo.py
    test_guardrails.py
    test_validators.py
    test_charts.py
```

### 2.2 Key Design Rules (from Spec §1.4 / Appendix D)

1. `simulation/` and `validation/` must have **zero** Streamlit imports.
2. `utils/charts.py` must have **zero** Streamlit imports (returns `go.Figure` objects).
3. Only `app.py` and `ui/` import Streamlit.
4. The simulation engine must be deterministic for a given seed and inputs.
5. Per-year guardrail logic loops over years but vectorizes across all `n_paths` simultaneously.

### 2.3 Variable Naming Convention

The spec defines normative variable names. Where the current code diverges, rename to match the spec:

| Current Name | Spec Name | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initial_portfolio` | `port_start` | Rename in models and all references |
| `annual_spending` | (removed — replaced by spending tiers) | Tiers provide per-age spending |
| `mean_return` | `ret_mean` | Rename |
| `return_std` | `ret_std` | Rename |
| `mean_inflation` | `inf_mean` | Rename |
| `inflation_std` | `inf_std` | Rename |
| `years` | `plan_years` | Rename |
| `num_simulations` | `n_paths` | Rename |
| `random_seed` | `random_seed` | No change |
| `guardrail_model` | (removed — replaced by GR1–GR4 toggles) | Spec uses 4 independent guardrails |

## 4) Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Foundation: Data Models + Validation

**Goal:** Establish the correct data structures and validation layer that all other modules depend on.

**Deliverables:**
1. Rewrite `simulation/models.py` with spec-aligned dataclasses and variable names
2. Create `validation/__init__.py` and `validation/validators.py`
3. Create `tests/test_validators.py`
4. Update `tests/test_models.py` for new model structure

**Details:**

1.1 **New `SimulationInputs` dataclass** (replaces `SimulationParams`):
- All fields from spec §2.2.1–2.2.7 with spec variable names
- Nested dataclasses: `SpendingTier`, `PortfolioBreakdown`, `SocialSecurityConfig`, `HealthInsuranceConfig`, `MarketAssumptions`, `GuardrailConfig` (with GR1–GR4 sub-configs)
- No business logic in models — pure data containers

1.2 **New `SimulationResults` dataclass** (replaces `SimulationSummary`):
- Matches spec §3.6 return structure
- Stores numpy arrays (n_paths × plan_years) for all required outputs
- Metadata fields (ages, n_paths, plan_years, inputs copy)
- Computed properties for summary statistics

1.3 **Validators module:**
- `validate_inputs(inputs: SimulationInputs) -> ValidationResult`
- `ValidationResult` contains `{valid: bool, errors: list[str], warnings: list[str]}`
- All rules from spec §2.3 implemented
- Zero Streamlit imports

**Acceptance:** All model unit tests pass; validators correctly block/warn per spec §2.3 table.

---

### Phase 2 — Simulation Engine Rewrite

**Goal:** Implement the full 8-step vectorized simulation loop with bivariate draws and all 4 guardrails.

**Deliverables:**
1. Create `simulation/engine.py` (new vectorized engine)
2. Create `simulation/guardrails.py` (guardrail logic module)
3. Create `tests/test_engine.py` and `tests/test_guardrails.py`
4. Deprecate/remove `simulation/monte_carlo.py` after migration

**Details:**

2.1 **Random draw generation** (spec §3.2):
- Bivariate normal using `np.random.default_rng().multivariate_normal()`
- Covariance matrix constructed from `ret_std`, `inf_std`, `ret_inf_corr`
- Inflation floor clipping: `inf_draws = np.clip(inf_draws, inf_floor, None)`
- Shape: `(n_paths, plan_years, 2)` split into `ret_draws` and `inf_draws`

2.2 **Vectorized year loop** (spec §3.3):
- Outer loop: `for y in range(plan_years)` (required for state-dependent guardrails)
- Inner dimension: all `n_paths` processed simultaneously via NumPy vectors
- 8 steps per year executed in spec order on vectors of shape `(n_paths,)`

2.3 **Spending tier lookup** (spec §3.4):
- `get_base_spend(age, tiers) -> float` — deterministic lookup
- Applied uniformly across all paths for a given year (same age = same base spend)
- Multiply by `cum_inf` vector to get nominal spending vector

2.4 **Guardrail module** (spec §3.5):
- Functions: `apply_gr1()`, `apply_gr2()`, `apply_gr3()`, `apply_gr4()`, `apply_floor_ceiling()`
- Each operates on vectors of shape `(n_paths,)` and returns modified spend vector + event codes
- Applied in sequence: GR1 → GR2 → GR3 → GR4 → floor/ceiling
- Event code array: dtype=object, stores string codes per spec

2.5 **Tax gross-up** (spec §3.3 Step 6):
- Static effective rate from initial account fractions
- `gross_withdrawal = net_withdrawal / (1 - effective_rate)` vectorized

2.6 **Result assembly** (spec §3.6):
- Return dict with all 13+ arrays of shape `(n_paths, plan_years)`
- Include metadata (ages list, n_paths, plan_years, deep copy of inputs)

**Acceptance:** Deterministic for fixed seed; performance <5s for 1000×35; all guardrail event codes generated correctly; edge cases (depletion, zero SS, all-survive, all-deplete) handled per spec §7.

---

### Phase 3 — Inputs UI Overhaul

**Goal:** Implement the complete Inputs tab with all 7 sections, dynamic spending tiers, portfolio presets, and inline validation.

**Deliverables:**
1. Rewrite `ui/inputs.py` — 7 collapsible sections per spec §2.1–2.2
2. Create `ui/scenarios.py` — scenario save/load/compare UI
3. Integrate validators for inline error/warning display
4. Wire to new `SimulationInputs` model

**Details:**

3.1 **Section rendering order** (spec §2.1):
- Portfolio → Personal Information → Spending → Social Security → Health Insurance → Portfolio Style / Market Assumptions → Guardrail Thresholds
- Each section in `st.expander` (or `st.columns` grouping)
- Run Simulation button at bottom

3.2 **Portfolio section** (spec §2.2.1):
- `port_start` (currency, required)
- 3 sub-account inputs with advisory sum validation
- `unrealized_gain_pct` slider
- `ltcg_rate` and `ord_income_rate` dropdowns

3.3 **Spending tiers** (spec §2.2.3):
- Dynamic tier list (1–5 tiers) with Add/Remove buttons
- Each tier: start_age, end_age, annual_spend
- Contiguity validation (inline error if gaps/overlaps)
- Floor/ceiling inputs below tiers

3.4 **Portfolio style presets** (spec §2.2.6):
- Selectbox with 6 options (Conservative through Custom)
- Auto-populates `ret_mean` and `ret_std` sliders on change
- Sliders remain editable after preset selection

3.5 **Guardrail sections** (spec §2.2.7):
- 4 independent toggle-controlled sections
- Sub-parameters hidden when parent toggle is off
- GR3 conditional on `aca_guardrail_enabled`

3.6 **Scenario management** (spec §2.4):
- Save current inputs as named scenario (text_input + button)
- Load scenario dropdown (restores all inputs)
- Max 5 scenarios in session_state
- Each stores inputs dict + most recent results dict

**Acceptance:** All spec §2.2 parameters rendered; validation messages match spec §2.3; presets auto-populate correctly; tier management is dynamic and validated.

---

### Phase 4 — Results UI + Charts

**Goal:** Implement the full Results tab with all metric cards, 7 sub-tabs, 6 charts, 5 downloadable tables, and scenario comparison.

**Deliverables:**
1. Rewrite `ui/outputs.py` — tabbed results layout per spec §4.1
2. Rewrite `utils/charts.py` — all 6 chart types per spec §4.4–4.5
3. Add CSV export functionality
4. Add `tests/test_charts.py` smoke tests

**Details:**

4.1 **Results tab structure** (spec §4.1):
- Run metadata row at top
- Summary dashboard (8 metric cards, spec §4.2)
- `st.tabs` with 7 sub-tabs: Success Metrics | Portfolio Fan | Spending Fan | Guardrail Analysis | Inflation Analysis | Tax Efficiency | Raw Data Tables

4.2 **Summary dashboard** (spec §4.2):
- 8 color-coded metric cards using `st.metric` in `st.columns`
- Green/Yellow/Red thresholds for survival rate
- Delta comparisons when comparison scenario loaded

4.3 **Success metrics table** (spec §4.3):
- Full-width `st.dataframe` with formatted columns
- 4 categories: Portfolio Outcomes (12 rows), Spending Outcomes (6 rows), Guardrail Trigger Frequencies (8 rows), Withdrawal Rate Statistics (5 rows)
- All computations as specified in spec formulas

4.4 **Charts** (spec §4.4):
- Chart 1: Portfolio fan chart — age X-axis, 5 percentile bands, shaded fill, SS/Medicare annotations, nominal/real toggle
- Chart 2: Spending fan chart — floor/ceiling horizontal lines, annotations
- Chart 3: Guardrail event stacked bar — per-age counts by event code
- Chart 4: Survival donut — survived vs depleted, center annotation
- Chart 5: WR over time — box plot OR fan (radio toggle), reference lines at 4%, 5%, 6.5%
- Chart 6: Inflation path fan — 10th/50th/90th bands, reference lines at inf_floor, inf_mean, gr4_inf_trigger

4.5 **Downloadable tables** (spec §4.5):
- 5 tables each with `st.dataframe` + `st.download_button` (CSV)
- Table 5 (full path data) shows size warning before generation

4.6 **Scenario comparison** (spec §4.6):
- Available when ≥2 scenarios saved
- Side-by-side metrics table with delta column
- Overlaid median fan chart (two scenarios, distinct colors)

4.7 **Stale results banner** (spec §6.3):
- Track `results_stale` in session_state
- Set True when any input changes; cleared after run
- Display prominent banner on Results tab when True

**Acceptance:** All 6 chart types render correctly; metrics match spec computations; CSV downloads produce valid files; nominal/real toggle works; annotations appear at correct ages.

---

### Phase 5 — Integration, Polish, and Test Coverage

**Goal:** Wire all modules together in `app.py`, ensure end-to-end flow works, expand test coverage, and perform final verification. (Deprecated module cleanup is handled in earlier phases — see §7.2.)

**Deliverables:**
1. Update `app.py` to wire new modules (inputs → validate → simulate → display)
2. Implement state management per spec §6.3
3. Expand test suite for edge cases (spec §7)
4. Performance verification
5. Final code review pass for spec compliance

**Details:**

5.1 **App wiring:**
- Inputs tab calls `render_inputs()` → returns `SimulationInputs`
- Validate via `validate_inputs()` — display errors/warnings inline
- If valid, run engine → store results in `session_state["results"]`
- Results tab reads from session_state, calls `render_outputs()`

5.2 **State management** (spec §6.3):
- `st.session_state["inputs"]`: validated inputs dict
- `st.session_state["results"]`: full result dict from engine
- `st.session_state["scenarios"]`: list of {name, inputs, results} (max 5)
- `st.session_state["results_stale"]`: bool flag

5.3 **Error handling** (spec §7):
- Portfolio depletion → zero for all subsequent years
- Cap gross_withdrawal at portfolio_start
- Zero SS case handled
- All-survive and all-deplete display behaviors
- Invalid covariance matrix blocks run
- Spending tier gaps block run
- No-results prompt on Results tab

5.4 **Performance verification:**
- Benchmark: 1000 paths × 35 years < 5 seconds
- If exceeded, profile and optimize vectorization

**Acceptance:** Full end-to-end simulation runs; all spec edge cases handled; test coverage >90% on engine and validators; performance target met.

### 5.2 `simulation/engine.py` — Vectorized Engine Outline

```python
def run_simulation(inputs: SimulationInputs) -> dict:
    """Execute Monte Carlo simulation per spec §3.1–3.7.

    Returns dict matching spec §3.6 structure.
    """
    # 1. Validate covariance matrix
    # 2. Generate bivariate normal draws (n_paths × plan_years × 2)
    # 3. Apply inflation floor
    # 4. Initialize result arrays
    # 5. Year loop (vectorized across paths):
    #    Steps 1–8 per spec §3.3
    # 6. Assemble and return result dict
```

Key vectorization pattern:
```python
cum_inf_vec = np.ones(n_paths, dtype=float)
for y in range(plan_years):
    age = retire_age + y
    ret_vec = ret_draws[:, y]          # shape (n_paths,)
    inf_vec = inf_draws[:, y]          # shape (n_paths,)
    cum_inf_vec *= (1.0 + inf_vec)     # running compounded inflation; shape (n_paths,)

    # All guardrail + portfolio ops use np.where on vectors
    spend_vec = apply_guardrails(spend_vec, portfolio_vec, ...)
    spend_vec = np.clip(spend_vec, floor * cum_inf_vec, ceil * cum_inf_vec)
    # ... portfolio update ...
```

### 5.3 `validation/validators.py` — Validation Design

```python
@dataclass
class ValidationResult:
    valid: bool
    errors: list[str]    # block-run conditions
    warnings: list[str]  # advisory only

def validate_inputs(inputs: SimulationInputs) -> ValidationResult:
    """Validate all inputs per spec §2.3 rules."""
    errors = []
    warnings = []

    # BLOCK rules

    if not _tiers_cover_horizon(inputs): errors.append(...)
    if inputs.spend_floor >= inputs.spend_ceiling: errors.append(...)
    if not _gr2_rates_ordered(inputs.gr2): errors.append(...)
    if not _covariance_valid(inputs): errors.append(...)
    if inputs.health.aca_magi_target >= inputs.health.aca_magi_cliff: errors.append(...)

    if inputs.inf_floor > inputs.inf_mean: warnings.append(...)

    return ValidationResult(valid=len(errors) == 0, errors=errors, warnings=warnings)
```

### 5.4 `utils/charts.py` — Chart Functions Required

| Function | Spec Chart | Key Features |

| --- | --- | --- |
| `simulation/models.py` | `tests/test_models.py` | Dataclass defaults, tier validation helpers, config construction |
| `simulation/engine.py` | `tests/test_engine.py` | Determinism (seed), bivariate correlation, all guardrail triggers, depletion, all-survive, all-deplete, performance benchmark |
| `simulation/guardrails.py` | `tests/test_guardrails.py` | Each GR in isolation, sequential application, floor/ceiling enforcement, event code correctness |
| `validation/validators.py` | `tests/test_validators.py` | Each validation rule: confirm error vs warning vs pass; boundary values |
| `utils/charts.py` | `tests/test_charts.py` | Each chart function returns valid `go.Figure`; correct number of traces; no exceptions on edge data |

### 6.2 Integration Tests

- End-to-end: construct `SimulationInputs` → validate → run engine → verify result dict structure and types
- Regression: known-seed outputs stored as fixtures; assert outputs match after refactoring

### 6.3 Performance Tests

- Benchmark: 1000 paths × 35 years must complete in <5s (assert in CI)
- Memory: peak memory for 10,000 paths × 50 years should be documented (not a hard gate for V1)

## 7) Migration Notes

### 7.1 Breaking Changes

- `SimulationParams` → `SimulationInputs` (different fields, different names)
- `MonteCarloSimulator` class → `run_simulation()` function
- `SimulationResult` / `SimulationSummary` → dict-based result structure
- `GuardrailModel` enum removed entirely
- All current UI code will be rewritten (not incrementally patched)

### 7.2 Recommended Migration Path

Since the app is **not currently in use** and the spec requires near-total rewrite of logic, the recommended approach is to **replace in place** rather than building in parallel:

1. Rewrite/replace modules directly — no need to keep old code running alongside new code
2. Delete deprecated modules at the end of the phase that replaces them (not deferred to Phase 5)
3. The app may be non-functional between phases — this is acceptable given no active users

**Per-phase deletion schedule:**

| Deprecated File | Delete At | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `simulation/monte_carlo.py` | End of Phase 2 | Replaced by `simulation/engine.py`; keep readable (not imported) during Phase 2 as reference |
| `tests/test_monte_carlo.py` | End of Phase 2 | Replaced by `tests/test_engine.py` |
| `tests/test_models.py` (old) | End of Phase 1 | Replaced by new `tests/test_models.py` for rewritten models |
| Old `GuardrailModel` enum | End of Phase 1 | Removed as part of `models.py` rewrite |

**Note:** This approach does not harm the testing plan because:
- Tests are rewritten per phase with their own acceptance gates
- Old tests assert against types that no longer exist after Phase 1 (cannot run anyway)
- New tests provide equivalent or greater coverage before old files are deleted

### 7.3 Files to Create (New)

- `simulation/engine.py`
- `simulation/guardrails.py`
- `validation/__init__.py`
- `validation/validators.py`
- `ui/scenarios.py`
- `tests/test_engine.py`
- `tests/test_guardrails.py`
- `tests/test_validators.py`
- `tests/test_charts.py`

### 7.4 Files to Rewrite (Major Changes)

- `simulation/models.py` — complete rewrite
- `ui/inputs.py` — complete rewrite
- `ui/outputs.py` — complete rewrite
- `utils/charts.py` — complete rewrite
- `app.py` — significant restructure
- `tests/test_models.py` — rewrite for new model structure

### 7.5 Files to Remove (per-phase deletion — see §7.2)

- `simulation/monte_carlo.py` — end of Phase 2
- `tests/test_monte_carlo.py` — end of Phase 2
- `tests/test_models.py` (original) — end of Phase 1 (replaced in same phase)

## 8) Implementation Priority and Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    P1[Phase 1: Models + Validation] --> P2[Phase 2: Engine]
    P1 --> P3[Phase 3: Inputs UI]
    P2 --> P4[Phase 4: Results + Charts]
    P3 --> P5[Phase 5: Integration]
    P4 --> P5
```

- **Phase 1** is a prerequisite for all other phases (defines shared types)
- **Phase 2** (engine) and **Phase 3** (inputs UI) can proceed in parallel after Phase 1
- **Phase 4** (results) depends on Phase 2 (needs engine output format)
- **Phase 5** (integration) depends on all prior phases

---

## 9) Acceptance Criteria (Overall)

The implementation is complete when:

1. All inputs from spec §2.2 are rendered with correct types, ranges, and defaults
2. All validation rules from spec §2.3 produce correct block/warn behavior
3. Simulation engine produces deterministic results matching spec §3.3 (8-step loop)
4. All 4 guardrails fire correctly per spec §3.5 event code table
5. All 8 summary metric cards display correct values per spec §4.2
6. All 6 charts render per spec §4.4 with correct annotations and toggles
7. All 5 downloadable tables export valid CSV per spec §4.5
8. Scenario management supports save/load/compare per spec §2.4
9. Stale results banner appears when inputs change per spec §6.3
10. Performance target met: <5s for 1000 paths × 35 years
11. Zero Streamlit imports in `simulation/` and `validation/` modules
12. Test coverage >90% on engine and validators
13. All spec §7 edge cases handled correctly

## 10) Open Questions for Implementation

These should be resolved at the start of each phase:

1. **Phase 1:** Should `SimulationInputs` use frozen dataclass or allow mutation for scenario editing?
2. **Phase 2:** Should the engine return a dict (spec literal) or a typed dataclass wrapping the dict for IDE support?
3. **Phase 3:** Should spending tiers use `st.data_editor` (newer API) or manual `st.columns` rows?
4. **Phase 4:** For Table 5 (full path export), what is the maximum n_paths threshold before showing a size warning?
5. ~~**Phase 5:** Should deprecated modules be removed in a separate commit for clean git history?~~ Resolved: deprecated modules are removed at end of each replacing phase (see §7.2).
